This project, Urban Z, is a new platform that aims to bring the best of physical store experiences to the online world. It caters to Gen Z's preferences for social shopping by offering features such as group buying, chat rooms, and virtual try-on. Users can create virtual shopping rooms with unique codes, inviting friends to chat and browse together in real time. The platform also includes a wishlist and group cart for collaborative shopping. The virtual try-on feature allows users to upload images of themselves and try on various clothing items virtually. The future scope includes expanding the virtual try-on feature to incorporate a wider range of clothing items, including bottoms, dresses, and accessories.
